### Introduction to AI Infrastructure Testing

The **AI Infrastructure Testing** category of the AI Architecture Model addresses the security and reliability of the **supporting components** that enable the AI system to function—such as APIs, model gateways, vector databases, compute environments, deployment pipelines, and orchestration agents.

While models receive much of the focus in AI risk discussions, vulnerabilities in the infrastructure layer can be just as damaging. Attackers may exploit **insecure endpoints, permission misconfigurations, logging leaks, or exposed APIs** to gain access to models, data, or prompt injection surfaces. Additionally, agent-based systems and retrieval-augmented architectures introduce new **runtime risks** that do not exist in traditional software stacks.

Infrastructure testing ensures that AI systems are **secure by design** and **resilient by default**, particularly in production environments where interconnected services amplify the attack surface.

### Scope of This Testing Category

This category evaluates whether the AI infrastructure:

- Protects against **unauthorized access** to the model, system prompts, or inference APIs  
  → *AITG-INF-01: Testing for Inference API Exposure*  
  → *AITG-INF-02: Testing for System Prompt Disclosure*

- Is hardened against **injection or exfiltration via middleware layers**, such as vector stores, plugins, or prompt chaining  
  → *AITG-INF-03: Testing for Vector Store Exploitation*  
  → *AITG-INF-04: Testing for Plugin Abuse*

- Does not leak sensitive **runtime data, chat history, or session metadata**  
  → *AITG-INF-05: Testing for Chat Exfiltration Channels*  
  → *AITG-INF-06: Testing for Token/Session Leakage*

- Enforces **least privilege and permission boundaries** across agents, APIs, and chained systems  
  → *AITG-INF-07: Testing for Agent Permission Escalation*

- Is protected against **Denial-of-Service (DoS) and resource consumption** exploits specific to LLM-backed systems  
  → *AITG-INF-08: Testing for Model DoS via Input Size or Encoding Attacks*

- Is regularly monitored for **misconfiguration, version disclosure, and supply chain vulnerabilities**  
  → *AITG-INF-09: Testing for Infrastructure Misconfiguration*  
  → *AITG-INF-10: Testing for Dependency and Runtime Supply Chain Risks*

By rigorously testing the AI infrastructure, organizations can **prevent lateral movement**, **reduce attack surface**, and **build operational resilience** for AI systems deployed at scale.

### Introduction to AI Model Testing

The **AI Model Testing** category of the AI Architecture Model focuses on validating the intrinsic properties and behaviors of the model itself—independent of its deployment context or external interactions. This layer of testing targets the **core robustness, reliability, and alignment** of the trained AI model, ensuring it performs safely and consistently even when exposed to adversarial scenarios or unexpected inputs.

AI models are probabilistic and high-dimensional, which means even small perturbations in input or training data can produce disproportionate or unintended outputs. As a result, **model-level vulnerabilities**—such as susceptibility to evasion, poisoning, or inversion attacks—must be systematically identified and mitigated to prevent catastrophic misuse, information leakage, or performance degradation.

### Scope of This Testing Category

This category evaluates whether the model:

- Is resilient to **adversarial perturbations or evasion attacks**, ensuring output integrity even with manipulated inputs  
  → *AITG-MOD-01: Testing for Adversarial Robustness*

- Is robust against **training-time threats**, such as data poisoning or backdoor insertion, that could compromise model reliability or safety  
  → *AITG-MOD-02: Testing for Data Poisoning*  
  → *AITG-MOD-03: Testing for Backdoor Behavior*

- Does not unintentionally **memorize and regurgitate sensitive training data**  
  → *AITG-MOD-04: Testing for Training Data Memorization*  
  → *AITG-MOD-05: Testing for Membership Inference*  
  → *AITG-MOD-06: Testing for Model Inversion*

- Cannot be **replicated or extracted** by attackers using public-facing APIs  
  → *AITG-MOD-07: Testing for Model Extraction*

- Exhibits **predictable, explainable behavior** across input distributions, including edge cases and OOD samples  
  → *AITG-MOD-08: Testing for Out-of-Distribution Generalization*  
  → *AITG-MOD-09: Testing for Explainability Failures*

Model testing ensures the **technical trustworthiness** of AI systems, addressing low-level model vulnerabilities that traditional software security testing may miss. These evaluations are essential for certifying AI readiness in regulated, high-stakes, or safety-critical environments.

### Introduction to AI Data Testing

The **AI Data Testing** category of the AI Architecture Model focuses on ensuring the **quality, integrity, provenance, and security of the data** used throughout the AI lifecycle‚Äîincluding training datasets, evaluation benchmarks, real-time inputs, and retrieved external content.

Data is the foundational layer of all AI systems. Corrupted, poisoned, biased, or incomplete data can degrade model performance, cause unintentional harms, or introduce exploitable behaviors. In many cases, **data-based attacks** do not target the model directly‚Äîbut rather manipulate or exploit the **training or inference data** to indirectly subvert system behavior.

Robust data testing practices are essential to building **trustworthy AI**, especially in applications involving personalization, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), sensitive topics, or regulatory oversight (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, AICPA).

### üîç Scope of This Testing Category

This category evaluates whether the data used in the AI system:

- Is **clean, consistent, and free from training-time poisoning or backdoor triggers**  
  ‚Üí *AITG-DAT-01: Testing for Training Data Poisoning*  
  ‚Üí *AITG-DAT-02: Testing for Data Injection/Backdoor Patterns*

- Maintains appropriate **privacy boundaries** and does not allow reconstruction or inference of sensitive records  
  ‚Üí *AITG-DAT-03: Testing for Training Data Memorization*  
  ‚Üí *AITG-DAT-04: Testing for PII Leakage or Presence*  
  ‚Üí *AITG-DAT-05: Testing for Membership Inference from Training Data*

- Has **verified provenance and traceability** for regulatory and quality assurance  
  ‚Üí *AITG-DAT-06: Testing for Data Provenance Validation*

- Is free from **demographic, representational, or outcome bias**  
  ‚Üí *AITG-DAT-07: Testing for Dataset Bias (Representation & Outcome Disparity)*

- Is **semantically aligned and structurally validated** for consistency across modalities  
  ‚Üí *AITG-DAT-08: Testing for Data Label Inconsistencies and Structural Errors*  
  ‚Üí *AITG-DAT-09: Testing for Multi-Modal Data Alignment Errors*

- Has appropriate **security controls** in retrieval-augmented pipelines  
  ‚Üí *AITG-DAT-10: Testing for RAG Index Corruption and Poisoning*

AI Data Testing closes the loop between **Responsible AI** and **Secure AI**, ensuring that the system‚Äôs behavior remains grounded in safe, fair, and accurate information‚Äîeven in adversarial settings.

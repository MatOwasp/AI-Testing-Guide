### üü¶ Introduction to AI Application Testing

The **AI Application Testing** category of the AI Architecture Model focuses on identifying and mitigating security and trust-related risks that directly emerge from how an AI system interacts with end-users and external data sources. This includes how inputs are processed, how outputs are generated, and how malicious actors may attempt to exploit these interactions.

### üîç Scope of This Testing Category

This category evaluates whether the model:

- Adheres to input and output constraints even under adversarial manipulation (e.g., AITG-APP-01 to AITG-APP-06)
- Maintains information boundaries and avoids disclosing or leaking sensitive content (e.g., AITG-APP-03, AITG-APP-07)
- Responds accurately, without hallucinations or bias, in sensitive domains (e.g., AITG-APP-10 to AITG-APP-12)
- Supports safe and transparent decision-making by ensuring explainability, traceability, and proper attribution of sources (AITG-APP-14)
- Resists over-personification or agentic overreach (AITG-APP-06, AITG-APP-13)

Each test in this category contributes to a **holistic security posture** for generative AI systems, encompassing safety, robustness, ethics, and compliance.

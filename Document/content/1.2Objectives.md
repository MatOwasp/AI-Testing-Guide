### Objectives of AI Testing

The primary objectives of AI testing include ensuring the quality, security, and ethical compliance of AI systems. This guide focuses on several key testing dimensions:

- **AI Model Testing**: Evaluating the accuracy, robustness, and reliability of AI models, including testing for training data poisoning.
- **AI Implementation Testing**: Ensuring that the integration of AI models into broader systems is secure and functional, including testing for data encryption and secure storage.
- **AI System Testing**: Examining the overall functionality and interoperability of the integrated AI systems.
- **AI Runtime Testing**: Continuously monitoring the deployed AI systems for vulnerabilities such as prompt injection attacks, verifying the correctness and appropriateness of outputs, assessing data quality, and maintaining high performance and reliability.

Key tests covered in this guide include:
- **Test for Training Data Poisoning**: Preventing and identifying manipulated training data that could compromise model integrity.
- **Testing for Storing Encryption**: Ensuring data at rest and in transit is encrypted and secure against unauthorized access.
- **Test for Prompt Injection**: Detecting and mitigating malicious inputs intended to manipulate AI behavior.
- **Test for Output**: Confirming AI outputs align with expected accuracy, appropriateness, and ethical guidelines.
- **Test for Data Quality**: Ensuring input data is accurate, complete, and representative.
- **Test for Performance and Reliability**: Continuously evaluating AI system responsiveness, stability, scalability, and reliability under varied conditions.

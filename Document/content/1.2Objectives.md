### 1.1 Objectives of AI Testing Guide

The **AI Testing Guide** aims to provide a structured, practical, and security-oriented framework for evaluating the **robustness, trustworthiness, and resilience** of AI systems. The focus is on helping **AI security testers, auditors, red teamers, MLOps engineers, and developers** to understand, model, and validate risks specific to **AI applications, models, infrastructure, and data pipelines**.

### Who It's For
The Guide is intended to the following audience:

- **AI Security testers** looking to go beyond traditional vulnerability scanning and assess model behaviors.
- **AI Auditors and compliance teams** verifying adherence to Responsible AI standards.
- **AI Engineeds, Developers and MLOps professionals** needing actionable insights into how to make AI systems resilient and trustworthy.
- **AI Red teamers** performing adversarial evaluations or generative AI red teaming.

## Methodology: From Threat Modeling to Testing

This guide is structured around a clear methodology:

1. **Threat Modeling**  
   We create a general AI system model that is broken down into its architectural components. Threats are identified across four main domains:
   - Application
   - Model
   - Infrastructure
   - Data

2. **Threat Mapping**  
   We map threats from multiple sources:
   -OWASP Top 10 for LLM
   - OWASP AI Exchange
   - Responsible and Trustworthu AI frameworks.

4. **Test Design**  
   For each identified threat, we design corresponding test cases. Each test includes:
   - Payload examples
   - Expected behavior
   - Detection strategy
   - Suggested tools

## What This Project Does NOT Cover

This guide **does not attempt to replace or duplicate** existing foundational security testing methodologies. Instead, it complements them by focusing on **AI-specific threats**. For general system and application security, we recommend the following best-in-class references:
